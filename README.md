F3D VZBOT FOR RATRIG MOUNT
PROBE MOUNT, MAG+ DUCT & SHROUD, COUPLE OTHER MODS

Fan shrouding works a bit better - its mainly just thinker and more compact than the OG VZ fan shrouds. The probe mount is just a simple peice that will mount both your X probe and your Z probe. Surley you can alter them to fit whatever probe you are using.

IMPORTANT NOTE - THESE ARE DESIGNED FOR ORBITER2 - For LGX lite your will need to modify the top of the probe mount to allow for clearance. shoudlnt be hard.


---PANELS---
roughly 1kg per panel. These are very tricky to print, especially without an enclosure.

I ended up printing them wtiha  0.8 CHT at 0.3 layer ehight. 3 bottom layers, 1 top layer. 15% cubic infill.
Anymore than 1 top layer, it will quickly warp. and "long line infills will make it warp, need to use hex, 3d hex, or gyroid.

These are desiegned to be used with these: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09V4KCZJ2/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?smid=AQNWFZ81EZN1L&psc=1&fbclid=IwAR3Ct1gZyP_nXEflg-vhswD1c3Wu61sEmtCw43VWllIcooVFKilpoi38xxE
That adhere to the inside of the panels.
